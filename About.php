        <p>By saving and recycling usable and edible food, not only are lives being saved but also the environment is being pushed in a positive direction.  One of the main contributors to this waste of food is restaurants.  In order to hold restaurants accountable for their waste and to provide healthy and quality meals for the local homeless, a system needs to be in place that encourages eateries to use their surplus to feed the poor.<br></p>

   <p> A needy person is someone who can never get enough attention or help. They have no tolerance for being alone. They're clingy. Being needy ultimately means needing more from the person you are with than they think you should need from them, or than they need from you.</p>
